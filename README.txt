## CF Custom Google Search

The CF Custom Google Search plugin allows a site owner to replace the default WordPress search functionality with Google Site Search functionality. Use of this plugin does require a configured Google Site Search account and API key to function.

### Usage

The CF Custom Google Search admin page allows for the configuration of the Google Site Search code. Search Engine ID and API key are required fields.

To display results on the page, edit your search.php template in the theme, and add in a call to use the shortcode "cf-google-search-results". This will get the results markup from the plugin.
